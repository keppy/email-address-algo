This library is a showcase of sorting & ordering. We implement an ordered set in Clojure to retain the order of a list of email addresses. We then manipulate that data to create a sorted set using clojure's PersistentTreeMap.

This is a fast implementation on hundreds of thousands of records in memory it performs both steps in under a second.
